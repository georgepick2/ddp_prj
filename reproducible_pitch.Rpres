Introduction
========================================================

In this presentation we introduce the Flower Species Predictor app.
We use the *iris* dataset from R to train a *random forest* predictor.
We use the predictor to determine the species based on user input.

Data
========================================================

The data come from the *iris* dataset. This is a summary of the data:

```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

Algorithm
========================================================

We use the *random forest* machine learning algorithm to make our predictions.
The application uses the entire iris data set for training. 

```{r}
library(randomForest)
modFit <- randomForest(Species~., data=iris)
modFit
```

Prediction
========================================================

A prediction is performed as follows:

* The user enters the data using four sliders. The data consist of sepal length/width and petal length/width. 
* The application tracks user input dynamically without making a prediction. The point corresponding to the user selection is shown in black since we don't know the species at this time. 
* The user clicks on the *Determine Species* button below the sliders. The server runs a prediction on the given data and the point is now colored in the color corresponding to the predicted species.
